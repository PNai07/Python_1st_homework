# Functions
# Run blocks of code when called
# They should be unitary / small
# They can take in argumets

# function is like a machine
# it can take in inputs
# it can perform actions
# it can output different objects

#An argument in a function is a variable that exists only in the scop of the function
#syntax

#def name_function(arg1, arg2):
#runs blocks of code



def full_name(f_name, l_name):
  return f_name + ' ' + l_name


result_function = full_name('Hamza', 'Danielson')
print(result_function)


# These arguments can only be used inside the block of code


# Good practices
# - functions should be unitary/ small jobs/ one job
# - arguments should have good names
# - functions should be used to keep the oode DRY
# - DRY - Don't repeat yourself
# -
